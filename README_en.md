## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

We recommend using Conda to manage the environment.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/[Your-GitHub-Username]/[Your-Repo-Name].git
cd [Your-Repo-Name]

# Create and activate the conda environment
conda create -n [your_env_name] python=3.8
conda activate [your_env_name]

# Install dependencies
# The requirements.txt file should list all dependencies such as pytorch, torchvision, numpy, tqdm, etc.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Data Preparation

Please download the [Dataset Name] dataset from [Link to Dataset] and extract it to the `data/` directory. The directory structure should be as follows:

```
[Your-Repo-Name]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Dataset-Name]/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### 3. Pre-trained Models

You can download our pre-trained model weights from [Link to Hugging Face Hub / Google Drive].

Place the downloaded `.pth` or `.pt` file into the `checkpoints/` folder.

### 4. Evaluation

To evaluate our pre-trained model on the [Dataset Name] test set, run the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py \
    --model_name [your_model_name] \
    --checkpoint_path checkpoints/[your_model_weight_file].pth \
    --data_dir data/[Dataset-Name]
```

### 5. Training

If you want to train the model from scratch, run:

```bash
# Single-GPU training
python train.py \
    --model_name [your_model_name] \
    --data_dir data/[Dataset-Name] \
    --epochs 100 \
    --batch_size 64 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4

# (Optional) Multi-GPU training
# torchrun --nproc_per_node=[NUM_GPUS] train.py ...
```

## üìä Experimental Results

We have validated the effectiveness of our method on several benchmarks.
