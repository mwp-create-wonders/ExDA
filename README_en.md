## ‚ú® Main Features

*   **Efficient Detection & Attribution Framework (ExDA)**: We introduce **ExDA**, an efficient framework designed for the precise detection and reliable attribution of AI-generated special regulatory images.

*   **Robust Visual Feature Processing**: Leverages a frozen **CLIP:ViT-L/14** as the backbone to extract unbiased and robust visual features. This is coupled with our novel **SFS-ResNet**, which innovatively replaces basic layers with **MMConv** to efficiently filter redundant information and capture high-frequency discriminative features crucial for forgery detection.

*   **Content-Agnostic Design**: By decoupling the text encoder and introducing a **text feature dimensionality reduction layer**, ExDA minimizes interference from specific image content. This allows the model to focus on the underlying generation artifacts rather than the image's semantics.

*   **Plug-and-Play Attribution**: The framework includes a highly extensible **attribution plugin** with few-shot learning capabilities. It can memorize low-level generator fingerprints from just a handful of unseen examples, effectively addressing real-world accountability and tracing challenges.

*   **Pioneering Dataset (ExImage)**: To support research in this critical area, we have constructed and released the **ExImage dataset**. This dataset fills a significant research gap concerning special regulatory images, which are of great importance for social stability and national security.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

We recommend using Conda to manage the environment.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/[Your-GitHub-Username]/[Your-Repo-Name].git
cd [Your-Repo-Name]

# Create and activate the conda environment
conda create -n [your_env_name] python=3.8
conda activate [your_env_name]

# Install dependencies
# The requirements.txt file should list all dependencies such as pytorch, torchvision, numpy, tqdm, etc.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Data Preparation

Please download the [Dataset Name] dataset from [Link to Dataset] and extract it to the `data/` directory. The directory structure should be as follows:

```
[Your-Repo-Name]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Dataset-Name]/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### 3. Pre-trained Models

You can download our pre-trained model weights from [Link to Hugging Face Hub / Google Drive].

Place the downloaded `.pth` or `.pt` file into the `checkpoints/` folder.

### 4. Evaluation

To evaluate our pre-trained model on the [Dataset Name] test set, run the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py \
    --model_name [your_model_name] \
    --checkpoint_path checkpoints/[your_model_weight_file].pth \
    --data_dir data/[Dataset-Name]
```

### 5. Training

If you want to train the model from scratch, run:

```bash
# Single-GPU training
python train.py \
    --model_name [your_model_name] \
    --data_dir data/[Dataset-Name] \
    --epochs 100 \
    --batch_size 64 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4

# (Optional) Multi-GPU training
# torchrun --nproc_per_node=[NUM_GPUS] train.py ...
```
